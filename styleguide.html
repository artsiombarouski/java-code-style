        <p>The intention of this guide is to provide a set of conventions that encourage good code.
            It is
            the distillation of many combined man-years of software engineering and Java development
            experience. While some suggestions are more strict than others, you should always
            practice good
            judgement.</p>
        <p>If following the guide causes unnecessary hoop-jumping or otherwise less-readable code,
            <em>readability
                trumps the guide</em>. However, if the more 'readable' variant comes with perils or
            pitfalls,
            readability may be sacrificed.</p>

        <h3 id="formatting">Formatting</h3>
        <h4 id="use-line-breaks-wisely">Use line breaks wisely</h4>
        <p>There are generally two reasons to insert a line break:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <li><p>Your statement exceeds the column limit.</p></li>
            <li><p>You want to logically separate a thought.<br/> Writing code is like telling a
                story.
                Written language constructs like chapters, paragraphs, and punctuation (e.g.
                semicolons,
                commas, periods, hyphens) convey thought hierarchy and separation. We have similar
                constructs in programming languages; you should use them to your advantage to
                effectively
                tell the story to those reading the code.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="indent-style">Indent style</h4>
        <a>We use the &quot;one true brace style&quot; (<a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS">1TBS</a>). Indent
            size is 2
            columns.</a>
        <pre><code>
-> Like this.
if (x &lt; 0) {
    negative(x);
} else {
    nonnegative(x);
}

-> Not like this.
if (x &lt; 0)
  negative(x);

-> or this
if(x &lt; 0)
negtive(x);</code></pre>
        <h4>Continuation indent is 4 columns. Nested continuations may add 4 columns or 2 at each
            level.</h4>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
- Line breaks are arbitrary.
- Scanning the code makes it difficult to piece the message together.
throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Failed to process request&quot; + request.getId()
    + &quot; for user &quot; + user.getId() + &quot; query: &#39;&quot; + query.getText()
    + &quot;&#39;&quot;);

-> Good.
- Each component of the message is separate and self-contained.
- Adding or removing a component of the message requires minimal reformatting.
throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Failed to process&quot;
    + &quot; request &quot; + request.getId()
    + &quot; for user &quot; + user.getId()
    + &quot; query: &#39;&quot; + query.getText() + &quot;&#39;&quot;);
</code></pre>
        <h4>Don't break up a statement unnecessarily.</h4>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
final String value =
    otherValue;

-> Good.
final String value = otherValue;
</code></pre>
        <h4>Method declaration continuations.</h4>
        <pre><code>
-> Sub-optimal since line breaks are arbitrary and only filling lines.
String downloadAnInternet(Internet internet, Tubes tubes,
    Blogosphere blogs, Amount&lt;Long, Data&gt; bandwidth) {
  tubes.download(internet);
  ...
}

-> Acceptable.
String downloadAnInternet(Internet internet, Tubes tubes, Blogosphere blogs,
    Amount&lt;Long, Data&gt; bandwidth) {
  tubes.download(internet);
  ...
}

-> Nicer, as the extra newline gives visual separation to the method body.
String downloadAnInternet(Internet internet, Tubes tubes, Blogosphere blogs,
    Amount&lt;Long, Data&gt; bandwidth) {

  tubes.download(internet);
  ...
}

-> Also acceptable, but may be awkward depending on the column depth of the opening parenthesis.
public String downloadAnInternet(Internet internet,
                                 Tubes tubes,
                                 Blogosphere blogs,
                                 Amount&lt;Long, Data&gt; bandwidth) {
  tubes.download(internet);
  ...
}

-> For easy scanning and extra column space.
public String downloadAnInternet(
    Internet internet,
    Tubes tubes,
    Blogosphere blogs,
    Amount&lt;Long, Data&gt; bandwidth) {

  tubes.download(internet);
  ...
}
</code></pre>
        <h4 id="chained-method-calls">Chained method calls</h4>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
- Line breaks are based on line length, not logic.
Iterable&lt;Module&gt; modules = ImmutableList.&lt;Module&gt;builder().add(new LifecycleModule())
    .add(new AppLauncherModule()).addAll(application.getModules()).build();

-> Better.
- Calls are logically separated.
- However, the trailing period logically splits a statement across two lines.
Iterable&lt;Module&gt; modules = ImmutableList.&lt;Module&gt;builder().
    add(new LifecycleModule()).
    add(new AppLauncherModule()).
    addAll(application.getModules()).
    build();

-> Good.
- Method calls are isolated to a line.
- The proper location for a new method call is unambiguous.
Iterable&lt;Module&gt; modules = ImmutableList.&lt;Module&gt;builder()
    .add(new LifecycleModule())
    .add(new AppLauncherModule())
    .addAll(application.getModules())
    .build();
</code></pre>
        <h4 id="column-limit">100 column limit</h4>
        <p>You should follow the convention set by the body of code you are working with. We tend to
            use 100
            columns for a balance between fewer continuation lines but still easily fitting two
            editor tabs
            side-by-side on a reasonably-high resolution display.</p>

        <h4>Naming convention</h4>
        <pre><code>
-> UpperCamelCase for types.
class Example {}

-> lowerCamelCase for variables.
public String name;

-> UPPER_SNAKE for constants
public static final String ACTION_ID = 1;
</code></pre>

        <h4 id="no-trailing-whitespace">No trailing whitespace</h4>
        <p>Trailing whitespace characters, while logically benign, add nothing to the program.
            However, they
            do serve to frustrate developers when using keyboard shortcuts to navigate code.</p>
        <h3 id="field-class-and-method-declarations">Field, class, and method declarations</h3>
        <h4 id="modifier-order">Modifier order</h4>
        <p>We follow the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/">Java Language
            Specification</a> for
            modifier ordering (sections <a
                    href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.1">8.1.1</a>,

        </p>
        <pre><code>

        <h4 id="variable-naming">Variable naming</h4>
        <p id="extremely-short-variable-names-should-be-reserved-for-instances-like-loop-indices.">
            Extremely short variable names should be reserved for instances like loop indices.</p>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
- Field names give little insight into what fields are used for.
class User {
  private final int a;
  private final String m;
  ...
}

-> Good.
- Fields provide enough information to understand their purpose
class User {
  private final int ageInYears;
  private final String maidenName;
  ...
}
</code></pre>
        <h4 id="include-units-in-variable-names">Include units in variable names</h4>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
long pollInterval;
int fileSize;

-> Good.
long pollIntervalMs;
int fileSizeGb.
</code></pre>
        <h4 id="dont-embed-metadata-in-variable-names">Don't embed metadata in variable names</h4>
        <p>A variable name should describe the variable's purpose. Adding extra information like
            scope and
            type is generally a sign of a bad variable name.</p>
        <p>Avoid embedding the field type in the field name.</p>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
Map&lt;Integer, User&gt; idToUserMap;
String valueString;

-> Good.
Map&lt;Integer, User&gt; usersById;
String value;
</code></pre>
        <p>Also avoid embedding scope information in a variable. Hierarchy-based naming suggests
            that a
            class is too complex and should be broken apart.</p>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
String _value;
String mValue;

-> Good.
String value;
</code></pre>
        <h4 id="space-pad-operators-and-equals">Space pad operators and equals.</h4>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
- This offers poor visual separation of operations.
int foo=a+b+1;

-> Good.
int foo = a + b + 1;
</code></pre>
        <h4 id="be-explicit-about-operator-precedence">Be explicit about operator precedence</h4>
        <p>Don't make your reader open the <a
                href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html">spec</a>
            to
            confirm, if you expect a specific operation ordering, make it obvious with parenthesis.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
return a &lt;&lt; 8 * n + 1 | 0xFF;

-> Good.
return (a &lt;&lt; (8 * n) + 1) | 0xFF;
</code></pre>
        <h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
        <p>The more visible a piece of code is (and by extension - the farther away consumers might
            be), the
            more documentation is needed.</p>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
/**
 * This is a class that implements a cache.  It does caching for you.
 */
class Cache {
  ...

-> Good.
/**

 */
class Cache {
  ...
}
</code></pre>
        <h4 id="documenting-a-class">Documenting a class</h4>
        <p>Documentation for a class may range from a single sentence to paragraphs with code
            examples.
            Documentation should serve to disambiguate any conceptual blanks in the API, and make it
            easier
            to quickly and <em>correctly</em> use your API. A thorough class doc usually has a one
            sentence
            summary and, if necessary, a more detailed explanation.</p>
        <pre><code>
/**
 * An RPC equivalent of a unix pipe tee.  Any RPC sent to the tee input is guaranteed to have
 * been sent to both tee outputs before the call returns.
 *
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the tee&#39;d service.
 */
public class RpcTee&lt;T&gt; {
  ...
}
</code></pre>
        <h4 id="documenting-a-method">Documenting a method</h4>
        <p>A method doc should tell what the method <em>does</em>. Depending on the argument types,
            it may
            also be important to document input format.</p>
        <pre><code>
-> Bad.
- The doc tells nothing that the method declaration didn&#39;t.
- This is the &#39;filler doc&#39;. It would pass style checks, but doesn&#39;t help anybody.
/**
 * Splits a string.
 *
 * @param s A string.
 * @return A list of strings.
 */
List&lt;String&gt; split(String s);

-> Better.
- We know what the method splits on.
- Still some undefined behavior.
/**
 * Splits a string on whitespace.
 *
 * @param s The string to split.  An {@code null} string is treated as an empty string.
 * @return A list of the whitespace-delimited parts of the input.
 */
List&lt;String&gt; split(String s);

-> Great.
- Covers yet another edge case.
/**
 * Splits a string on whitespace.  Repeated whitespace characters are collapsed.
 *
 * @param s The string to split.  An {@code null} string is treated as an empty string.
 * @return A list of the whitespace-delimited parts of the input.

        <h5 id="no-author-tags">No author tags</h5>
        <p>Code can change hands numerous times in its lifetime, and quite often the original author
            of a
            source file is irrelevant after several iterations. We find it's better to trust commit
            history
            and <code>OWNERS</code> files to determine ownership of a body of code.</p>

        <h3 id="use-annotations-wisely">Use annotations wisely</h3>
        <h4 id="nullable"><span class="citation">@Nullable</span></h4>
        <p>By default - disallow <code>null</code>. When a variable, parameter, or method return
            value may
            be <code>null</code>, be explicit about it by marking <a

}
</code></pre>
        <h4 id="visiblefortesting"><span class="citation">@VisibleForTesting</span></h4>
        <p>Sometimes it makes sense to hide members and functions in general, but they may still be
            required
            for good test coverage. It's usually preferred to make these package-private and tag

        <p>Constants are a great example of things that are frequently exposed in this way.</p>
        <pre><code>

        <h3 id="use-interfaces">Use interfaces</h3>
        <p>Interfaces decouple functionality from implementation, allowing you to use multiple
            implementations without changing consumers. Interfaces are a great way to isolate
            packages -
            provide a set of interfaces, and keep your implementations package private.</p>
        <p>Many small interfaces can seem heavyweight, since you end up with a large number of
            source files.
            Consider the pattern below as an alternative.</p>
        <pre><code>
interface FileFetcher {
  File getFile(String name);

  - All the benefits of an interface, with little source management overhead.
  - This is particularly useful when you only expect one implementation of an interface.
  static class HdfsFileFetcher implements FileFetcher {
    @Override File getFile(String name) {
      ...
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
        <h4 id="leverage-or-extend-existing-interfaces">Leverage or extend existing interfaces</h4>
        <p>Sometimes an existing interface allows your class to easily 'plug in' to other related
            classes.
            This leads to highly <a

            code.</p>
        <pre><code>
- An unfortunate lack of consideration. Anyone who wants to interact with Blobs will need to write specific glue code.
class Blobs {
  byte[] nextBlob() {
    ...
  }
}

- Much better. Now the caller can easily adapt this to standard collections, or do more complex things like filtering.
class Blobs implements Iterable&lt;byte[]&gt; {
  @Override
  Iterator&lt;byte[]&gt; iterator() {
    ...
  }

        <p><b>Warning</b> - don't bend the definition of an existing interface to make this work. If
            the
            interface
            doesn't conceptually apply cleanly, it's best to avoid this.</p>

        <h3 id="fakes-and-mocks">Fakes and mocks</h3>
        <p>When testing a class, you often need to provide some kind of canned functionality as a
            replacement for real-world behavior. For example, rather than fetching a row from a real
            database, you have a test row that you want to return. This is most commonly performed
            with a
            fake object or a mock object. While the difference sounds subtle, mocks have major
            benefits over
            fakes.</p>

        <h4 id="the-hidden-stress-test">The hidden stress test</h4>
        <p>Avoid writing unit tests that attempt to verify a certain amount of performance. This
            type of
            testing should be handled separately, and run in a more controlled environment than unit
            tests
            typically are.</p>
        <h4 id="thread.sleep">Thread.sleep()</h4>
        <p>Sleeping is rarely warranted, especially in test code. Sleeping is expressing an
            expectation that
            something else is happening while the executing thread is suspended. This quickly leads
            to
            brittleness; for example if the background thread was not scheduled while you were
            sleeping.</p>
        <p>Sleeping in tests is also bad because it sets a firm lower bound on how fast tests can
            execute.
            No matter how fast the machine is, a test that sleeps for one second can never execute
            in less
            than one second. Over time, this leads to very long test execution cycles.</p>
        <h4 id="avoid-randomness-in-tests">Avoid randomness in tests</h4>
        <p>Using random values may seem like a good idea in a test, as it allows you to cover more
            test
            cases with less code. The problem is that you lose control over which test cases you're
            covering. When you do encounter a test failure, it may be difficult to reproduce.
            Pseudorandom
            input with a fixed seed is slightly better, but in practice rarely improves test
            coverage. In
            general it's better to use fixed input data that exercises known edge cases.</p>

        <h4 id="leave-todos-early-and-often">Leave TODOs early and often</h4>
        <p>A TODO isn't a bad thing - it's signaling a future developer (possibly yourself) that a
            consideration was made, but omitted for various reasons. It can also serve as a useful
            signal
            when debugging.</p>
        <h4 id="leave-no-todo-unassigned">Leave no TODO unassigned</h4>
        <p>TODOs should have owners, otherwise they are unlikely to ever be resolved.</p>
        <pre><code>

        <h4 id="adopt-todos">Adopt TODOs</h4>

        <p>The Law of Demeter is most obviously violated by breaking the <a

        <p>Take what you need, nothing more. This often relates to <a href="#stay-out-of-texas">texas
            constructors</a> but it can also hide in constructors or methods that take few
            parameters. The
            key idea is to defer assembly to the layers of the code that know enough to assemble and
            instead
            just take the minimal interface you need to get your work done.</p>

        <p>If you want to provide a convenience constructor, a factory method or an external factory
            in the
            form of a builder you still can, but by making the fundamental constructor of a Weigher
            only
            take the things it actually uses it becomes easier to unit-test and adapt as the system
            involves.</p>
        <h4 id="in-methods">In methods</h4>
        <p>If a method has multiple isolated blocks consider naming these blocks by extracting them
            to
            helper methods that do just one thing. Besides making the calling sites read less like
            code and
            more like english, the extracted sites are often easier to flow-analyse for human eyes.
            The
            classic case is branched variable assignment. In the extreme, never do this:</p>
        <p>Instead of this:</p>

      throw new LayerSpecificException(&quot;Failed to look up weight for &quot; + subject, e)
    }
  } else {
    weight = defaultInitialRate * (1 + onlineLearnedBoost);
  }

  Use weight here for further calculations
}</code></pre>
        <p>Do this:</p>
        <pre><code>

        <p>A code reader that generally trusts methods do what they say can scan calculate quickly

        <p>When spawning a thread, either directly or with a thread pool, you need to take special
            care that
            you properly manage the lifecycle. Please familiarize yourself with the concept of
            daemon and
            non-daemon threads (and their effect on the JVM lifecycle) by reading the documentation
            for <a
                    href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html">Thread</a>.
            Failing to understand these concepts can cause your application to hang at shutdown.</p>
        <p>Shutting down an <a
                href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html">ExecutorService</a>
            properly is a slightly tricky process (see javadoc). If your code manages an executor
            service
            with non-daemon threads, you need to follow this procedure. <a
                    href="[ExecutorService](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html)">ExecutorServiceShutdown</a>
            very nicely contains this behavior for you.</p>
        <p>If you want to automatically perform cleanup like this when the VM is shutting down,
            consider
            registering with <a
